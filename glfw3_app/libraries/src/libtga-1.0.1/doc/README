This directory contains the SGML sources for the Libtga documentation.
You will need to install the DocBook DTD, the DocBook Stylesheets and some sort
of a SGML parser (e.g. OpenJade) to transform these sources.
The DocBook version used is 3.1, newer versions of the DTD should also work.
An HTML version is available at http://tgalib.sourceforge.net
